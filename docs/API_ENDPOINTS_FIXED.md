# API Endpoints - Fixed and Verified

## Summary
The pricing APIs are working correctly and fetching real-time data. The issue was incorrect endpoint paths being used. The external API connectivity is functioning properly with the recent caching implementation.

## Current Status
- ✅ External APIs (CoinGecko, Binance) are working
- ✅ Real-time BTC price: $111,066 (as of testing)
- ✅ SQLite caching is operational
- ✅ Fixed missing `_cache_durations` attribute error

## Working Endpoints

### 1. Current Price
```
GET /price/current

Response:
{
    "price": 111066,
    "volume": 34964725516.66488,
    "change_24h": 1.9462618159813352,
    "timestamp": "2025-07-09T21:52:08.465523"
}
```

### 2. Latest BTC Data
```
GET /btc/latest

Response:
{
    "latest_price": 111066,
    "timestamp": "2025-07-09T21:52:11.747282",
    "price_change_percentage_24h": 1.9462618159813352,
    "high_24h": 111742.0,
    "low_24h": 108369.0,
    "total_volume": 20488865138.27645,
    "market_cap": 2165787000000
}
```

### 3. Market Data (OHLCV)
```
GET /market/btc-data

Response:
{
    "symbol": "BTC-USD",
    "period": "1mo",
    "data": [
        {
            "timestamp": "2025-06-09T00:00:00",
            "Open": 105779.28,
            "High": 110543.89,
            "Low": 105372.62,
            "Close": 110302.12,
            "Volume": 17851.91
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

## Issues Fixed

1. **Cache Configuration Error**: Added missing `_cache_durations` and `_default_cache_duration` attributes to `ExternalDataFetcher` class
2. **Endpoint Documentation**: Documented correct API endpoints (previous attempts were using non-existent endpoints like `/api/price`)
3. **Port Configuration**: Backend runs on port 8090, not 8000

## Verification
All external API sources are functioning:
- CoinGecko: ✅ Working (primary source)
- Binance: ✅ Working (secondary source)
- Cache hit rate is improving as the system warms up

## Notes
- The "static values" mentioned in the issue were likely being shown when using incorrect endpoints that returned 404 errors
- The fallback price of $95,000 is only used when ALL external APIs fail, which is not happening currently
- Cache TTLs are properly configured for different data types (price: 60s, OHLCV: 300s, etc.)
