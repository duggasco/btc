# API Endpoints Health Report

## Summary
All critical API endpoints have been tested and fixed to ensure they return real-time data instead of static fallback values.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Static/Fallback Price Values
**Found in multiple endpoints:**
- Hardcoded prices: $45,000, $50,000, $95,000, $108,000
- Fixed by replacing with `get_current_btc_price()` calls
- Now all endpoints fetch real-time prices from external APIs

### 2. Cache Serialization Error
**Issue:** DataFrame objects not JSON serializable causing cache failures
**Impact:** Some API calls may be slower without caching
**Status:** Non-critical - APIs still work, just without cache optimization

### 3. Broken Endpoints Fixed
- `/analytics/portfolio-comprehensive` - 500 error (missing 'realized_pnl')
- `/analytics/performance` - 500 error (missing 'sharpe_ratio' attribute)
- Several POST endpoints had missing required fields in test payloads

## Working Endpoints

### Price & Market Data ✅
```
GET /price/current         - Real-time BTC price (~$111,000)
GET /btc/latest           - Latest market data with volume
GET /market/btc-data      - Historical OHLCV data
GET /market/data          - Comprehensive market indicators
```

### Trading Signals ✅
```
GET /signals/latest       - Current trading signal
GET /signals/enhanced/latest - Enhanced ML signals
GET /signals/comprehensive - All 129 indicators
GET /signals/history      - Historical signals
```

### Portfolio & Analytics ✅
```
GET /portfolio/metrics    - Portfolio performance
GET /analytics/pnl        - P&L analysis
GET /analytics/risk       - Risk metrics (VaR, CVaR)
GET /analytics/correlations - Feature correlations
GET /analytics/optimization - Strategy optimization
```

### System Status ✅
```
GET /                     - API health check
GET /health              - Detailed component status
GET /system/status       - System operational status
```

## Verification Results

### External API Connectivity
- **CoinGecko**: ✅ Working ($110,978 fetched)
- **Binance**: ✅ Working (backup source)
- **CryptoCompare**: ✅ Working (tertiary source)

### Real-Time Data Confirmation
- Current BTC price: ~$111,000 (not static)
- 24h volume: ~$25B (realistic)
- Market cap: ~$2.18T (calculated dynamically)

## Recommendations

1. **Cache Issue**: The DataFrame serialization error should be addressed to improve performance
2. **Error Handling**: Some endpoints still return generic errors - could be more descriptive
3. **Documentation**: Update API docs with correct endpoint paths and required parameters
4. **Monitoring**: Add endpoint health monitoring to catch issues early

## Conclusion
All critical pricing and data endpoints are now functioning correctly with real-time data. The system is no longer returning static fallback values for normal operations.
